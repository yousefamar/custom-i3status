# Custom i3status

A custom i3status-like script for i3bar

Not really meant for public use (lots of hardcoding) but if you're interested, open issues and I'll make it useable.

## Installation

Run:

    sudo npm install -g custom-i3status

## Usage

In your i3config, change this line:

    status_command i3status

to this line:

    status_command custom-i3status
